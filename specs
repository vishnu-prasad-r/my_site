[7:40:11 PM IST] adamcooperman: No problem, we are very flexible
[7:40:30 PM IST] adamcooperman: We expect a high standard of work but in actual fact you have up to 4 weeks to complete the work
[7:40:53 PM IST] adamcooperman: Although that does not mean that we will authorise 4 weeks of 20 hours for payment
[7:41:57 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: I think the project wouldn't take more than 30 hours. Even if it takes, you are supposed to pay only for 40 hours.
[7:42:10 PM IST] adamcooperman: Ok
[7:42:17 PM IST] adamcooperman: This is the first time I have hired on elance
[7:42:34 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: And be assured about the quality of work. I will give my best
[7:42:37 PM IST] adamcooperman: so long as this is done well I probably have enough work to keep you busy at least 20 hours per week for a few months
[7:42:47 PM IST] adamcooperman: possibly even more
[7:43:30 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: I wish we will be able to develop a long term business relationship
[7:43:35 PM IST] adamcooperman: Excellent

Tuesday 4 September 2012
[7:24:47 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: Hi
[7:24:55 PM IST] adamcooperman: Good morning
[7:24:58 PM IST] adamcooperman: well afternoon
[7:25:18 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: Its evening here 19:30
[7:25:25 PM IST] adamcooperman: Aha
[7:25:27 PM IST] adamcooperman: I was about to look it up
[7:25:48 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: I am waiting for a detailed specifications
[7:25:58 PM IST] adamcooperman: I have had a very busy weekend I am sorry
[7:26:13 PM IST] adamcooperman: Do you have the work in progress app still on your machine ?
[7:26:40 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: "work in progress app"?
[7:26:57 PM IST] adamcooperman: The application I sent you when we first discussed this job ?
[7:27:10 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: yes. thats here
[7:27:25 PM IST] adamcooperman: First of all the authentication is wrong, that is my code and its only half completed
[7:28:02 PM IST] adamcooperman: The styling from this site needs to stay the same
[7:28:18 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: ok
[7:28:44 PM IST] adamcooperman: We need to add authentication for admins, and division mangers and general users
[7:28:52 PM IST] adamcooperman: A single login is all that is required for general users,
[7:29:38 PM IST] adamcooperman: Bear with me I am going to write out the start of the specs
[7:29:45 PM IST] adamcooperman: That will be easier
[7:31:50 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: Oops .. I think I lost the code you sent me
[7:31:54 PM IST] adamcooperman: Dont worru
[7:31:56 PM IST] adamcooperman: I can resend
[7:32:00 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: k
[7:32:06 PM IST] adamcooperman: I am just look at the application atm
[7:32:07 PM IST] adamcooperman: bear with me
[7:32:54 PM IST] adamcooperman: there is a link http://5.79.6.23/
[7:33:04 PM IST] * adamcooperman sent file "TWL.zip"
[7:33:05 PM IST] adamcooperman: here is the code
[7:35:10 PM IST] adamcooperman: First of all - On the home page and the rules page any information containing email addresses/ addresses or phone numbers should only be available to logged in users.
[7:35:35 PM IST] adamcooperman: As should the players link and the teams link
[7:35:45 PM IST] adamcooperman: Fixtures and results should be public
[7:36:33 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: what information goes in Rules tab
[7:37:38 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: OK. I got it. the sites layout was little bit confusing
[7:37:43 PM IST] adamcooperman: no worries
[7:38:02 PM IST] adamcooperman: There should be a login for all basic players
[7:38:07 PM IST] adamcooperman: it can be the same across all basic players
[7:38:28 PM IST] adamcooperman: Then a login for divisional representatives - Premier - Div1 - Div2 -Div3 - Div4
[7:38:35 PM IST] adamcooperman: And a Admin login
[7:39:51 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: Is it ok that we have a single login page for all?
[7:40:00 PM IST] adamcooperman: Yes
[7:40:14 PM IST] adamcooperman: It is strange but that is what the client asked for
[7:41:27 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: ambiguity!!!!
[7:41:48 PM IST] adamcooperman: So one login page
[7:41:54 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: ok
[7:41:56 PM IST] adamcooperman: where all players can log in using a single login
[7:42:04 PM IST] adamcooperman: and then 5 logins for the different divisions
[7:42:12 PM IST] adamcooperman: and one for the admin
[7:42:23 PM IST] adamcooperman: the admin should be able to edit everything
[7:42:47 PM IST] adamcooperman: the divisional representatives should only be able to set scores for fixtures in the past within their division
[7:42:50 PM IST] adamcooperman: Does that make sense ?
[7:43:02 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: now its clear to me
[7:43:08 PM IST] adamcooperman: Ok
[7:44:07 PM IST] adamcooperman: Ideally the login should go at the top right on the navigation menu
[7:44:37 PM IST] adamcooperman: If not you can place a link to a login page at the top right of the navigation menu
[7:44:40 PM IST] adamcooperman: which ever you prefer
[7:45:19 PM IST] adamcooperman: Once logged in it should say logged in as Player or Admin or Div1/Div2/Div3/Div4/premier at the top right of the navigation menu
[7:46:24 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: Does the site have some sort of sign up feature? Or is it admin who create all users?
[7:46:32 PM IST] adamcooperman: Admin creates all users
[7:47:49 PM IST] adamcooperman: There should be a signup page that simply sends a message to the admin email address notifying the admin of the contact details of the player who wishes to sign up. The signup page should contain name, email, address, phone number, message
[7:49:20 PM IST] adamcooperman: The admin will then contact the player to talk to them and then create the account as necessary
[7:51:07 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: So can I redesign the authentication system, using something like Devise/CanCan
[7:51:25 PM IST] adamcooperman: either as you wish
[7:51:38 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: ok
[7:58:07 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: So, I may work on authentication system righ now and wait for your mail with more details.
[7:58:09 PM IST] adamcooperman: Yes
[7:58:18 PM IST] adamcooperman: I am putting together the rest of the specifications now
[7:58:28 PM IST] adamcooperman: I am sorry for the delay
[7:58:37 PM IST] adamcooperman: If you have any questions feel free to ask them here
[7:58:41 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: Thats fine.
[7:59:46 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: But I need to leave for an hour.
[7:59:52 PM IST] adamcooperman: No problem
[7:59:58 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: k
[8:00:01 PM IST] adamcooperman: What time will you normally be working on this application ?
[8:01:13 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: Either on 6pm-9pm or 9pm-2am IST.
[8:01:20 PM IST] adamcooperman: Ok perfect
[8:01:26 PM IST] adamcooperman: I will be online for all of that time every day
[8:01:37 PM IST] adamcooperman: See you later

[5:58:49 PM IST] adamcooperman: It is up to you, I am going to finish the specifications now to ensure its done
[6:00:06 PM IST] Vishnuprasad R: I have request. I am not a native English speaker and I am not very good at formal conversation. Excuse me if my tone appear to be impolite.
